## FAQ

### What are services?

Optimize is made up of multiple services which work together to provide all of the features of the platform. We define a service as being a component of our infrastructure, typically isolated from other components in a meaninful way.

### What does it mean when a service is down?

Generally a service being down means it is unavailable and as such the features that rely on that service will not work correctly.
